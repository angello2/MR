# MR
Assignments for Soft Computing (MR) at FER. The course consists of the following topics: fuzzy computing, evolutionary computing and neurocomputing.

Assignments are done in Java.

# Assignments 1 - 3
All three assignments are connected, each upgrading the previous one with additional classes. In the third, a fuzzy control system is implemented. It successfully drives a boat through a simulated river environment while adapting to randomly changing wind conditions. 

# Assignment 4
Genetic algorithm implementation. WIP
